# **MetaMark (`.mmk`) - Structured Markup & Collaboration**

## **📖 Introduction to MetaMark (`.mmk`)**
MetaMark (`.mmk`) is a **structured, human-readable markup language** designed for **version control, security, and collaboration**. It extends Markdown with built-in **commit tracking, encryption, annotations, real-time collaboration, and export functionality**.

MetaMark is built for speed, security, and scalability, offering both a **CLI tool (`mmk-cli`)** and a **collaboration server (`mmkd`)** for self-hosted or cloud-based document editing.

## **📁 Project Modules Overview**

### **1️⃣ Core (`metamark-core/`)**
The heart of MetaMark, the Core module is responsible for the fundamental functionality that makes `.mmk` files work. It implements the core parsing engine that understands MetaMark's extended syntax, handling everything from basic markdown to advanced features like encryption and annotations. The module provides robust security features including AES-256 encryption for sensitive content, digital signatures for document integrity, and secure key management. It's designed to be highly performant and thread-safe, making it suitable for both single-user and multi-user scenarios. The Core module serves as the foundation that other modules build upon, ensuring consistent behavior across all MetaMark implementations.

### **2️⃣ Command-Line Interface (`metamark-cli/`)**
The CLI module provides a powerful command-line interface for working with `.mmk` files. It offers a comprehensive set of tools for document management, version control, and file operations. Users can perform actions like committing changes, rolling back versions, exporting to various formats, and managing document security settings. The CLI is designed to be intuitive while providing advanced features for power users. It integrates seamlessly with the Core module for all operations and includes features like interactive mode for complex operations, batch processing capabilities, and extensive configuration options. The CLI is particularly useful for automation and integration with other tools in a developer's workflow.

### **3️⃣ Collaboration Server (`mmkd/`)**
The Collaboration Server module enables real-time document editing and version control across multiple users. It implements a sophisticated WebSocket-based synchronization system that ensures all users see the same document state in real-time. The server handles complex scenarios like conflict resolution using CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) algorithms, ensuring that concurrent edits don't result in data loss or inconsistencies. It includes robust authentication and authorization systems, supporting various authentication methods including OAuth 2.0 and JWT. The server is designed to be scalable and can handle thousands of concurrent connections, making it suitable for both small teams and large organizations.

### **4️⃣ GUI Editor (`metamark-editor/`)**
The GUI Editor module provides a modern, user-friendly interface for working with `.mmk` files. Built using Tauri for cross-platform compatibility, it offers a native-feeling experience while maintaining the power of web technologies. The editor includes features like real-time preview, syntax highlighting, and intelligent code completion. It provides visual tools for managing document structure, encryption settings, and version history. The editor is designed to be accessible to both technical and non-technical users, with an intuitive interface that hides complexity while making advanced features available when needed.
